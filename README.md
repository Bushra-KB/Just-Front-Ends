## Front-End(Web) Examples

<p> 
  These are Collection of front-end examples for teaching and learning web programming. These examples assume NO experience of front end by the reader. I myself had more experience as a backend engineer and found most front end examples required too much familiarity of HTML, Javascript and the front end stack. I journaled these examples to help myself and others.

  Web Programming is creating documents with HTML, styling/positioning the documents' content with CSS, and updating that content and servers based on events using JavaScript. We can break down the JavaScript part of web programming into three pillars that involve working with the DOM, JavaScript eventing and communication with the server. Now that we've seen how these pillars are connected in the abstract, we are ready to dive into seeing how they work together in detail.
